I created a toy contract that I could interact with to test that the block.timestamp was moving forward.

I have two different implementations that advance the time in the test.js file. You can see that the first version (the flawed one) works only when the contract state doesnâ€™t update. It passes in the first test suite, but as soon as I start updating the contract state by incrementing a uint256, I get the failure in the second test suite.

In the third suite, I show that the workaround solution works
